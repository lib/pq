# pq - A pure Go postgres driver for Go's database/sql package

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lib/pq.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lib/pq)

## Install

	go get github.com/lib/pq

## Docs

<http://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq>

## Use

	package main

	import (
		_ "github.com/lib/pq"
		"database/sql"
	)

	func main() {
		db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "user=pqgotest dbname=pqgotest sslmode=verify-full")
		// ...
	}

**Connection String Parameters**

These are a subset of the libpq connection parameters.  In addition, a
number of the [environment
variables](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/libpq-envars.html)
supported by libpq are also supported.  Just like libpq, these have
lower precedence than explicitly provided connection parameters.

See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/libpq-connect.html.

* `dbname` - The name of the database to connect to
* `user` - The user to sign in as
* `password` - The user's password
* `host` - The host to connect to. Values that start with `/` are for unix domain sockets. (default is `localhost`)
* `port` - The port to bind to. (default is `5432`)
* `sslmode` - Whether or not to use SSL (default is `require`, this is not the default for libpq)
	Valid values are:
	* `disable` - No SSL
	* `require` - Always SSL (skip verification)
	* `verify-full` - Always SSL (require verification)

Use single quotes for values that contain whitespace:

    "user=pqgotest password='with spaces'"

See http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql to learn how to use with `pq` through the `database/sql` package.

## Listening for notifications

PostgreSQL supports a simple publish/subscribe model over the database
connections. See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-notify.html for more information.

pq supports this using an infinite `Rows` object. When issuing a
`Query("LISTEN <channel>")`, the query is sent to the server, and
a special `Rows` object is returned. It always has the columns

* `bePid int` - The backend process ID
* `relname string` - The channel name
* `payload string` - The payload given to `NOTIFY`, or empty.

When the statement object is closed, an implicit `UNLISTEN` is sent
to the server.

The `Next()` method of the returned `Rows` will never reach EOF,
except if the connection is terminated. Note that while `Next()`
is being called, there is no way of interrupting the call.

## Tests

`go test` is used for testing.  A running PostgreSQL server is
required, with the ability to log in.  The default database to connect
to test with is "pqgotest," but it can be overridden using environment
variables.

Example:

	PGHOST=/var/run/postgresql go test github.com/lib/pq

Optionally, a benchmark suite can be run as part of the tests:

	PGHOST=/var/run/postgresql go test -bench .

## Features

* SSL
* Handles bad connections for `database/sql`
* Scan `time.Time` correctly (i.e. `timestamp[tz]`, `time[tz]`, `date`)
* Scan binary blobs correctly (i.e. `bytea`)
* pq.ParseURL for converting urls to connection strings for sql.Open.
* Many libpq compatible environment variables
* Unix socket support
* Notifications: `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`

## Future / Things you can help with

* Notifications: Allow listening on multiple channels at once
* `hstore` sugar (i.e. handling hstore in `rows.Scan`)
